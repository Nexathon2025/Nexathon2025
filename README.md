🛠️ About the Hackathon (Detailed Version) 

The Inter-College 24-Hour NEXATHON 2025 is a high-intensity innovation marathon designed to challenge engineering students to transform ideas into real, functional prototypes within a strict 24-hour window. It brings together passionate developers, designers, and innovators from various engineering branches to collaborate, problem-solve, and build impactful technological solutions.

NEXATHON is built on the belief that great ideas deserve a stage. The event provides an energetic, competitive, and collaborative environment where students can brainstorm, prototype, and engineer real-world solutions from scratch. With problem statements revealed on the spot, participants must think quickly, adapt creatively, and execute efficiently under time pressure.

The hackathon emphasizes hands-on learning, encouraging participants to apply their engineering knowledge through rapid development cycles—ideation, design, building, testing, and presenting—all within 24 hours. Teams use their technical skills to address challenges across multiple domains such as education, e-commerce, social impact, healthcare, local business development, defense, and more, depending on the themes provided.

Beyond coding, the hackathon cultivates interdisciplinary teamwork, where students from different backgrounds work together to combine creativity, logic, and engineering principles. It also serves as a bridge between academia and industry by promoting real-world thinking, practical problem-solving, and innovative solution building.

The hackathon aims to:

Promote practical, application-based engineering through intense hands-on development

Encourage innovation, creativity, and critical thinking

Boost team collaboration and communication

Strengthen industry-academia interaction by exposing participants to realistic problem statements

Inspire solutions that contribute to societal impact, sustainability, and ethical responsibility

At the end of the 24 hours, each team presents its working prototype to a panel of judges. Projects are evaluated on technical implementation, creativity, feasibility, societal impact, and presentation quality. The event concludes with recognition and awards for the most outstanding solutions.

In essence, NEXATHON is not merely a competition—it's a platform that empowers future engineers to innovate, collaborate, and bring meaningful ideas to life.
